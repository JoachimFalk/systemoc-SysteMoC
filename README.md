# SysteMoC library

The automatic identification of models of computation is the key for analysis as weel as efficient synthesis for hardware/sofwtare systems.
Programming language like Java, C++, etc. are Turing-complete and mostly restrict the analysis and synthesis.
Here, the project SysteMoC is located.
Based on the system design language SystemC, coding styles are defined which permit the identification of the underlying model of computation and, hence, allow for analysis and efficient synthesis of hardware/software systems.
