\index{guard}
\index{GUARD@\lstinline{GUARD}}
\begin{itemize}
\item a guard is a \lstinline!const! member function returning a boolean value
\begin{lstlisting}
  bool hasToken() const{
    return count<size;
  } // guard
\end{lstlisting}
\item guards enable/disable transitions (true/false)
\item guards must not change variable values or token in channels
\item refer to guards via \lstinline!GUARD(..)! macro 
\begin{lstlisting}
    start = 
      GUARD(Source::hasToken)  >>
      out(1)                   >>
      CALL(Source::src)        >> start;

\item variables ...
\item ... are \lstinline!private! class member of an actor

\index{actions}
\begin{itemize}
\item actions ...
\item ... are used to read/write data on input/output ports
\item ... modify variables
\begin{lstlisting}
  void src() {
    out[0] = message[count++];
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\item guards access variables read-only (mandatory \lstinline!const! modifier)
\item actions are allowed to modify variables

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile=singleslide]
\mode<presentation>{\frametitle{\insertsubsection\ -- Multiple Access}}
\index{port}
\begin{itemize}
\item you can write/read data more than once (overwrite/re-read)
\item e.g. read input twice
\begin{lstlisting}
  void sink() {
    char squareInput = in[0] * in[0];

    char x = in[0];
    char y = in[0]; // re-read
    assert(x == y);
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\item e.g. write a default value first
\begin{lstlisting}
  void src() {
    out[0] = 'X';    // default
    if(count<size){
      out[0] = message[count++]; //overwrite
    }
  }

\begin{frame}[fragile=singleslide]

\begin{itemize}
\item simulation output (using Sink actor from previous example)
\begin{lstlisting}
top.Sink recv: "0"
top.Sink recv: "1"
top.Sink recv: "2"
top.Sink recv: "3"
top.Sink recv: "4"
top.Sink recv: "5"
top.Sink recv: "6"
top.Sink recv: "7"
top.Sink recv: "8"
top.Sink recv: "9"
SystemC: simulation stopped by user.
\end{lstlisting}
\item Source actor sends a finite number of characters only
\item simulation terminates when no actor can be activated
\end{itemize}
