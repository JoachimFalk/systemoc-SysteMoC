\item lets have a look on some traps with data flow modeling
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item You will learn to ...
\item ... use data flow models.
\item ... beware or at least be aware of deadlocks.

\item the example consists of ...
\item ... two source actors, each producing a sequence of tokens
\begin{itemize}
\item one actor sends ``ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ''
\item the other actor produces the sequence ``012345''
\end{itemize}
\item ... a merge actor forwarding input data in alternating order
\item ... and a source to print out received data.
