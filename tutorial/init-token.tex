\item data flow graphs may contain cyclic dependencies
\item initial tokens are a common way to break cyclic dependencies

\item You will learn to ...
\item ... initialize queues.

\item each actor forwards input tokens to output port
\item network graph contains a cyclic dependency
\item without initialization none of the actors would become active
\item we may use an initial token to break the cyclic dependency
