\begin{itemize}
\item function \lstinline!sc_main! is the entry point for simulation (cf. SystemC)
\item the network graph is instantiated
\item parameters are passed to the graph constructor (e.g.``top'')
\item call \lstinline!sc_start! to start simulation (cf. SystemC)
\begin{lstlisting}
int sc_main (int argc, char **argv) {
  // create network graph
  HelloNetworkGraph top("top");
  smoc_scheduler_top sched(top);

  sc_start();  // start simulation (SystemC)
  return 0;
