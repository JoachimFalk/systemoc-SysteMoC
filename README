# find a tutorial and a docu in individual directories

# we shall share figures (directory figs) ...
# ... and common resources (e.g. BNF, definitions, ...) []
#
# the "HscdTex-Res" make process supports shared figures [is tested and in use]
# but it is a little bit picky with directory structure
#  refering to relative (e.g. ../figs) works only if all sharing projects are
#  located in different directories having the very same deepth
#
#  importing common tex file is untested ...
