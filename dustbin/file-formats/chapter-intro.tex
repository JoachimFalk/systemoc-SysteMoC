\begin{itemize}
\item \SystemCoDesigner{} is a system level synthesis tool
\item \SystemCoDesigner{} automatically maps a SystemC (\SysteMoC\ ) behavioral model onto a heterogeneous MPSoC
\item this is done by automatic design space exploration (DSE) for optimization purposes
\item the DSE engine
\begin{itemize}
\item uses a specification graph as input 
\item creates several implementation graphs as output
\end{itemize}
\item graphs are represented in corresponding XML files
\begin{itemize}
\item specification graph (file extension .sgx)
\item implementation graph (file extension .igx)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item specification graph and implementation graph are similar ...
\begin{itemize}
\item both use same file format (specgraph.dtd)
\end{itemize}
\item ... but interpretation differs
\begin{itemize}
\item a specification graph represents the entire design space,
\\ i.e., a variety of possible mappings of an application to a super set of the architecture
\item an implementation graph represents an implementation,
\\ i.e., a concrete mapping to a concrete architecture
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item a specification graph consists of 
\begin{itemize}
\item a problem graph representing the application (SystemC model)
\item an architecture graph (superset of MPSoC platform)
\item mappings of problem graph nodes to architecture graph nodes
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item the DSE gets a specification graph as input
\item allocation and binding are performed during exploration 
\begin{itemize}
\item allocation ... select a concrete set of resources
\item binding ... map each task to one resources
\end{itemize}
\item a concrete allocation and binding is named ``implementation''
\item several different implementations may be created from a specification
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\mode<presentation>{\frametitle{Design Space Exploration cont'd}}
\begin{itemize}
\item implementations are represented by implementation graphs
\begin{itemize}
\item an implementation graph is a copy of the specification graph ...
\item ... having all not allocated resources removed
\item ... and having all unused mappings removed
\end{itemize}
\item implementation graphs are used for evaluation of implementations
\begin{itemize}
\item e.g., scheduling, performance evaluation, cost estimation
\end{itemize}
\item evaluated performance numbers are fed back to the DSE
\end{itemize}
