\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have implemented a framework which \emph{separates actor functionality} and \emph{communication behavior}.
The communication behavior is \emph{machine extractable} from the executable specification.
As a result, the SystemC library named \SysteMoC{} was developed which provides the basis for representing executable specifications within a model-based design flow.
Currently, we applied SysteMoC to model an industrial relevant applications, and developed a model-based design flow for design space exploration.
In future work, we will integrate support to connect \SysteMoC{} actors into TLM designs to make industry benefit from analyzable \SysteMoC{} designs integrated into standard TLM designs.
