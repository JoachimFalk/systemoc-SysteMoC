\item \SysteMoC{} and \VPCs\ are the two modeling approaches used in \SystemCoDesigner{}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item \SysteMoC{} allows for functional modeling and simulation
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \VPCs\ (VPC) allow for performance modeling and simulation
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Together, \SysteMoC{} and \VPCs\, allow for combined functional and performance simulation
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Both, \SysteMoC{} and \VPCs\, are implemented as individual libraries on top of SystemC
