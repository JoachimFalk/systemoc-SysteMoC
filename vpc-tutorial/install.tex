VPC requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item A SysteMoC library compiled with VPC support
\item The application needs to be linked with the VPC library
\end{itemize}
library dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
\item CoSupport library (included in the SysteMoC source distribution)
\item Xerces-C++ XML Parser, http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/ (Version $\ge$ 2.8.0)
\item Boost C++ library, http://www.boost.org/ (Version $\ge$ 1.35)
\item SystemC library, http://www.systemc.org/ (Version $\ge$ 2.2.0)
\end{itemize}
note:
\begin{itemize}
\item Boost, SystemC, and CoSupport are required for SysteMoC
\item Xerces-C++ is required by the VPC library
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The source code distribution includes the subdirectories SysteMoC, Support, SystemC-VPC, and some Testcases and Examples
\item Create an obj directory and change the working directory
\item Run the configure script from the source directory
\item Compile the software (and optionally install it)
\end{itemize}
